# MyProject
This Repository is about an Idea I've Proposed and It's front-end will be uploaded to this repositry to show it's objective and working to the public and organizations.
The Project Title is "Updating The Tradional Way of Giving fatah in Taraweeh Prayers"
The system will be based on AI, which will include real-time comparison of Input data and Data stored at back-end in Database.
The Input will be taken in AUDIO form from microphone and thriugh the use of Speech-Text Conversion API it will be converted into textr and then it will be comapred with data stored and will generate an OUTPUT in AUDIO form using Text-Speech Conversion API. And this system will work on real-time as we've to convert the input and doing conversion at the same time and upon mismatch it's going to stop input/comparison process and has to generate output on real-time.
